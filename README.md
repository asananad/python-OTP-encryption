OTP is a python program that allows you to encrypt/decrypt ASCII text using the One Time Pad system as well as generate random keys, generate checksums and check files against them. The keys and encrypted files are formatted in the classical way that spies used to use when they did this by hand back in the day (blocks of 5 characters and 3 spaces in between)

OTP.py is a command line tool, OTP-GUI.py is a tkinter GUI program.

bitwise XOR uses the same principle as OTP but it works with byte data not just with ASCII text, that means anything can be encrypted with it, images, movies, songs, etc.
